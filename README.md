# myTruv — Brand System Overview

This is the **entry point** for the myTruv brand system — a **map of maps**.  
Start here to understand how all brand docs fit together and how to use them.

---

## 1. Purpose 🎯

This file exists to:

- Give everyone a **shared mental model** of the myTruv brand:
  - **Who we are:** a no‑hustle financial behavior autopilot  
    → one score, one scroll, calm guidance — even with messy, fluctuating income.
  - **Who we’re for:** middle‑income, hyper‑online US adults (30–40) who feel money is chaos, guilt and fatigue despite already using bank apps, spreadsheets and budgeting tools.
- Explain **what each brand doc is for** and **when to use which**.
- Act as the **source‑of‑truth index** for all brand, positioning, messaging and SEO decisions.

If you’re unsure where to look or how to talk about myTruv, you start here.

## 2. How to Use This System 🧭

Think of this folder as a stack:

- **Brand** defines **who we are** at a deep level.
- **Positioning** defines **how we want people to perceive us** vs alternatives.
- **Messaging** answers **what we say** in words.
- **Personas** answer **who we’re talking to** and what they care about.
- **SEO** answers **how people find us** in the wild (search, content).

Use it like this:

1. **Start with `brand.md`**  
   - When you need to align on **essence and principles**: values, tone, what we stand for, what we refuse to do.
   - If a decision feels off, check against brand first.

2. **Then read `positioning.md`**  
   - When you’re framing myTruv vs **budgeting apps, bank apps, gamified finance tools**, etc.
   - Use this for **product strategy, pitch decks, fundraising, high‑level marketing**.

3. **Use `messaging.md` to write anything outward‑facing**  
   - Websites, landing pages, ads, onboarding flows, product microcopy.
   - It translates brand + positioning into **actual sentences** and examples.

4. **Use `personas.md` when you need to choose a target or tone**  
   - For campaigns, features, emails, flows.
   - It helps you pick **who you’re talking to** (Exhausted Power User, Emotional iOS Spender, Self‑Employed with chaotic income, etc.) and adjust nuance.

5. **Use `seo.md` for search & content**  
   - For blog topics, landing pages, and keyword strategy.
   - It makes sure our **no‑hustle, one‑score, autopilot** story shows up where people are actually searching.

Whenever you’re stuck:

- **What are we?** → `brand.md`
- **How are we different?** → `positioning.md`
- **What exactly should we say?** → `messaging.md`
- **Who am I talking to?** → `personas.md`
- **How do they discover us?** → `seo.md`

## 4. Operating Rules ⚙️

### 4.1 Source of Truth

- This folder (`brand/` or equivalent) is the **single source of truth** for:
  - Brand identity (who we are).
  - Positioning (how we’re different).
  - Messaging (what we say, what we avoid).
  - Personas (who we target).
  - SEO direction (how we’re discovered).
- If there is a conflict between:
  - **Slides / Notion / Figma / random docs** and these files → **these files win**.
  - Internal hierarchy if there’s a clash:
    1. `brand.md`
    2. `positioning.md`
    3. `messaging.md`
    4. `personas.md`
    5. `seo.md`

### 4.2 Updates Policy

**When to update**

- When **product reality shifts** (e.g. we add/remove a core concept like the score, autopilot logic, target segment).
- When **data contradicts assumptions** (user research, quant, behavior).
- When messaging is consistently **misunderstood** or attracts the wrong audience.
- When **market context changes** (e.g. competitor acquisitions, Mint shutting down, etc.).

**How to update**

- Treat these docs like **code for the brand**:
  - Changes should be **intentional and documented**, not random edits.
  - Ideally:
    - Propose changes in a PR / change request / tracked comments.
    - Include a short **changelog entry** at the top or bottom of the file.
- For substantial changes:
  - Discuss with **brand/marketing + product** stakeholders.
  - Make sure updates are consistent across:
    - `brand.md` ↔ `positioning.md` ↔ `messaging.md`.

### 4.3 Ownership

*(Fill in concrete names as you see fit.)*

- **Primary owner (brand system):**
  - Role: Brand / Marketing Lead (or Founder until that exists).
  - Responsible for:
    - Keeping the system coherent.
    - Approving major changes.
    - Ensuring product & marketing use the same story.

- **Co‑owners:**
  - **Product Lead / PM:**
