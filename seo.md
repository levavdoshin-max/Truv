We keep the original research‑based clusters, but **tilt everything** toward:

- **no‑hustle** (low‑effort, minimal maintenance),
- **one simple score** as the main signal,
- **financial behavior autopilot** (works in the background),
- **fluctuating / irregular income**,
- **emotional relief** (“breathe out”),
- and **story‑based insights** (trips, big expenses, weird months).

## 9. Tone for SEO Content


**Principles:**

- Keep the same calm, supportive tone across all SEO articles:
  - Avoid “fix your bad habits”, “stop wasting money”, “be more disciplined”.
  - Prefer “see your situation clearly”, “understand what changed”, “breathe out a little”.
- Always acknowledge:
  - that classic tools (spreadsheets, budgeting apps, gamified finance) can feel exhausting,
  - that income and expenses can be **messy and irregular**,
  - that money stress is often about **system chaos**, not personal failure.

**Each article should:**

1. Start from a **real, emotional problem**:
   - tool fatigue,
   - irregular income,
   - anxiety / avoidance,
   - “I’m tired of budgeting”.

2. Show why classic solutions feel like **more work or more guilt**.

3. Introduce the **one score + one scroll + autopilot** idea:
   - low‑effort,
   - shame‑free,
   - works even with fluctuating income.

4. End with a **gentle CTA**:
   - “If you’re tired of budgeting apps but still want to know you’re okay, try myTruv as a no‑hustle, calm money check‑in.”
   - “If you want your money to feel like it runs on autopilot instead of being a second job, myTruv might be the next thing to try.”
