# myTruv – Brand Guide

## 0. Purpose

This guide defines **who myTruv is as a brand**:

- what we stand for,
- how we want people to feel,
- what we promise (and what we refuse to do),
- how we show up in product, design and language.

It is **not** a detailed target‑audience document – that lives in `personas.md`.  
Here we focus on the **core idea and personality** that must stay true for every segment.

Use this file to:

- brief designers, writers, PMs, engineers and partners,
- sanity‑check if a feature / campaign / UI “feels like myTruv”,
- onboard new people into the brand in 20–30 minutes.

## 1. Brand Essence

### 1.1 Brand idea

> **“Light, kind money – on AI autopilot.”**

Most money products say:

- “Track every dollar.”
- “Stick to your budget.”
- “Be your own CFO.”

People already tried. They installed apps, built spreadsheets, set up budgets –  
and still ended up with:

- chaos,
- guilt,
- and fatigue.

**myTruv’s core idea:**

> myTruv turns heavy, chaotic money into a **simple, always‑glad‑to‑see‑you AI companion**  
> that understands your real life, runs the “money brain” in the background,  
> and gives you **one calm score plus a few gentle, useful insights**.

Not “become a financial manager”.  
More like “you have a small, kind financial brain in your pocket”.

---

### 1.2 What we exist to change

Right now, money management feels like this for a lot of people:

- **Shame**  
  - You dread opening your banking app because it feels like a red report card.
  - You feel like you “failed” after you drop your streak or overspend.

- **Overload**  
  - Spreadsheets, categories, budgets, rules, alerts.
  - It feels like a second job: “doing money properly”.

- **Avoidance**  
  - You download the app → set everything up → miss a few days → feel ashamed → stop opening it.

myTruv flips this pattern:

1. **No shame for imperfect money.**  
   Opening myTruv should never feel like getting in trouble.  
   The app is always glad you came back.

2. **No “second job” as your own accountant.**  
   You don’t manage a system; the system manages itself.  
   You just open the app, see the picture, and get 1–2 next steps.

3. **You never have to justify yourself to the app.**  
   myTruv sees your whole context – income, bills, habits, goals –  
   and judges the **system**, not your “character”.

---

### 1.3 Non‑negotiable feelings

Every interaction with myTruv should land like this:

- **Welcome, not judged**  
  - “The app is happy I opened it, even if I’ve been gone for a while.”

- **Understood**  
  - “It actually gets my situation: my banks, my habits, my chaos, my trips, my bad weeks.”

- **Calm, not panicked**  
  - “I understand what’s going on, whether I’m safe, and what one small step looks like.”

- **Encouraged, not scolded**  
  - “I’m doing some things right already, and I know one tiny tweak that makes things better.”

If something creates the opposite feeling (panic, shame, overwhelm), it is off‑brand.

---

## 2. Audience (Brand‑level)

myTruv is **not** “only for middle‑income adults 30–40”.  
In principle it can help:

- students and people at the beginning of their money journey,
- full‑time employees and “working middle America”,
- self‑employed / freelancers with chaotic income,
- high earners who still feel disorganised or ashamed.

What unites them is **how money feels**, not age or income:

- “Money feels messy, heavy or embarrassing.”
- “I’ve already tried some tools (bank app, spreadsheet, budgeting app).”
- “I want honest clarity and low‑effort control, not another project.”

Detailed segments, examples and nuances live in `personas.md`.  
The **brand voice is the same for all of them**: light, kind, validating, always worth opening.

---

## 3. Positioning & Promise

### 3.1 What opening myTruv should feel like

**Scenario:**  
Someone hasn’t looked at their money for a while and opens myTruv with a little fear.

The first screen shows:

- **Truv Score** – a calm indicator of system health, not a grade on the person.
- A short, kind summary, e.g.:
  - “Overall you’re in a safe zone.”
  - “This month is heavier because of X, but your cushion is holding up.”
- **1–3 insights or suggestions**, with at least one clearly positive.

It might sound like:

- “Good news: even with your Vegas weekend, your safety cushion is still okay.”
- “Delivery spending is higher this month, but you kept other extras lower – net‑net, you’re fine.”
- “You handled those surprise bills without touching your last line of defence. That really matters.”

It should **never** sound like:

- “You blew your budget.”
- “You failed your streak.”
- “You’re behind.”

---

### 3.2 Core promise (JTBD)

> **“Help me feel like my money is under control  
>  without complicated budgets, even when my cashflow is messy,  
>  and without constant shame or guilt.”**

This is the job myTruv must do, regardless of persona.

---

### 3.3 Brand pillars

1. **Low‑effort control**  
   - No need to build a perfect budget or maintain 20 categories.  
   - The app does the heavy thinking; you see **1–3 clear next steps**.

2. **Designed for messy, fluctuating income**  
   - Works when paychecks are irregular, gig income comes in waves, or expenses spike.  
   - myTruv smooths the noise and shows a “steady‑state” view: safe vs risky.

3. **Emotionally safe & shame‑free**  
   - No red “YOU OVERSPENT” screens.  
   - We acknowledge systemic pressure (rent, healthcare, inflation).  
   - We focus on improving your **money system**, not blaming you.

4. **A layer on top of what you already use**  
   - myTruv doesn’t replace your bank app or spreadsheet – it **sits on top of them**.  
   - It connects accounts, reads patterns and turns them into one clear picture.

5. **Progress without exposing numbers**  
   - You can share your Truv Score, rings, streaks and wins.  
   - You never have to share salary, balances or exact spend.

## 4. Key Messages & Taglines

### 4.1 Brand one‑liners

Use and remix these lines across surfaces:

- **“AI money companion for messy real life.”**
- **“Financial autopilot, not another budgeting app.”**
- **“Feel in control without living in a spreadsheet.”**
- **“Money under control, without becoming your own accountant.”**
- **“One calm score. A few simple steps.”**

### 4.2 Segment‑specific angles (overview)

Details live in `personas.md`. High‑level hooks:

**Exhausted power users**

- “You’ve already tried bank apps, Excel and budgeting tools. myTruv is the smart AI layer that finally makes them work together.”
- “Not another dashboard. One score and a couple of smart moves.”

**Self‑employed / freelancers**

- “Turn irregular income into a predictable rhythm.”
- “A cashflow calendar that understands your chaos and quietly builds buffers for taxes, insurance and slow months.”

**Busy full‑time employees**

- “You already have a full‑time job. Don’t add ‘CFO’ on top.”
- “myTruv runs in the background and surfaces only the decisions that matter this week.”

**Non‑finance‑nerds**

- “One clear score. One next step. No finance jargon.”
- “You don’t have to be ‘good with money’. You just need a system that has your back.”

**High‑anxiety users**

- “Money without shame. We fix the system, not your worth.”
- “You’re not ‘bad with money’. You were never given a simple, honest system. We build it with you.”

### 4.3 What we explicitly do *not* say

Things that sound like guilt, blame or extra work:

- “Track every dollar.”
- “Fix your bad money habits.”
- “Stop wasting money.”
- “Be smarter with money.”
- “Take full control of your finances.”

Rewrite into supportive framing:

- “We’ll help you see where your system is leaking.”
- “Small weekly steps make your money calmer over time.”
- “We make your existing tools and accounts work together.”
- “Even with irregular income you can feel stable – we smooth the chaos.”

## 5. Product Narrative & Features (Brand View)

### 5.1 What myTruv feels like

**Not:** a prettier budgeting spreadsheet.  
**Instead:** a **health dashboard for your money system** plus a pocket companion.

When you log in, you see:

1. **Truv Score** – the health of your system (cushions, stability, risk), not your income.
2. **Short diagnosis** in plain language, for example:
   - “You’re in a safe zone as long as you don’t add new subscriptions.”
   - “Eating out is close to your usual limit – one small adjustment keeps you on track.”
3. **1–3 next steps**, each doable in a few minutes:
   - “Move $20 to your safety cushion today.”
   - “Pause one delivery app this week.”
   - “Pay $30 extra on this card to avoid interest.”

Everything else is optional.

### 5.2 Feature stories (how we talk about them)

**Cashflow smoothing**

- “myTruv looks at your noisy income and bills and builds a ‘steady paycheck’ version of your life.”
- “We calculate your safe daily / weekly burn, even when deposits come in unevenly.”
- “You always know whether you’re running in a safe zone or quietly eating your cushion.”

**Buffers & cushions**

- “We quietly build buffers for taxes, healthcare, emergencies and big bills.”
- “You see which future punches you’re already protected against, and where your armour is still thin.”

**Behaviour autopilot**

- “You don’t need to think about money every day. myTruv watches patterns for you.”
- “We nudge you only when it matters:
  - ‘If this trend continues, your cushion gets fragile in X months.’  
  - ‘Right now is a good moment to add a little to your safety net.’”

**Truv Score, rings, streaks**

- “Your Truv Score reflects the health and resilience of your system, not the size of your salary.”
- “Someone on $45k and someone on $95k can both reach ‘Elite’ if their systems are stable.”
- “You can share score, rings and streaks without sharing raw numbers.”

## 6. Voice & Tone

### 6.1 Personality

- **Calm** – no drama, no scare tactics.
- **Kind** – like a supportive friend, not a strict teacher.
- **Honest** – we name real structural issues (rent, healthcare, inflation).
- **Practical** – we always land in one clear, small action.
- **Tech‑comfortable, human‑sounding** – AI inside, human on the outside.

### 6.2 Principles

1. **Normalize, don’t shame**

   - “It’s normal for money to feel messy.”
   - “Most people were never really taught how to do this.”

2. **Shrink the task**

   - No 20‑page strategic plans.  
   - “Here’s one habit for this week. That’s enough.”

3. **Separate person from system**

   - “The system around your money is fragile. Let’s make it more resilient.”
   - Not “you’re bad”, but “the setup is hurting you; let’s fix it.”

4. **Celebrate progress**

   - “You just avoided $120 in fees this year.”
   - “Your cushion is one paycheck thicker than a month ago.”

### 6.3 Do / Don’t examples

**DO**

- “Restaurants were higher than usual this month. You’re still okay – skipping one or two outings next month keeps you in the green.”
- “You’ve been consistent for 9 days. That’s what real change looks like.”
- “Your system absorbed that surprise bill without panic. That’s exactly what we’re building.”

**DON’T**

- “You overspent on restaurants again.”
- “You failed to stick to your budget.”
- “You’re bad at controlling your impulses.”

Rewrites:

- “You overspent again on delivery this week.”  
  → “Delivery has been creeping up. Skip just one order this week and your cushion stays on track.”

- “Stop making bad choices with your credit card.”  
  → “Your credit card is doing more heavy lifting than usual. One extra payment now prevents interest from snowballing.”

## 7. Social & Community

### 7.1 What we encourage people to share

Because openness reduces anxiety but most people hate sharing raw numbers.

We **encourage sharing**:

- Truv Score progress (e.g. 47 → 63),
- streaks (“14 days in the green zone”),
- rings (“Safety ring closed 5 times this week”),
- small wins (“Cancelled 3 useless subscriptions”, “Built my first one‑month cushion”).

We **do not require** sharing:

- income,
- balances,
- detailed spending.

### 7.2 Social framing

- “Share your discipline and wins, not your salary.”
- “Flex your system, not your bank balance.”
- “The only number your friends see is how consistently you show up.”

---

## 8. Boundaries & Honesty

We are **not**:

- a magic income booster,
- a replacement for a job, raise or systemic change,
- a financial education course with lectures and homework.

We **are**:

- a way to make your existing income **more resilient and less chaotic**,
- a system that squeezes more safety and calm out of the money you already earn,
- a supportive layer that keeps you moving even when life is noisy.

Honest copy examples:

- “We can’t change rent or healthcare prices. We can help you build a cushion so they don’t knock you over.”
- “We can’t promise you’ll never feel stressed about money. We can promise you won’t be facing it alone or blind.”

---
